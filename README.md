pureweb3
This repository has been created to test native browser support for web3 sites.

All of the Unstoppable Domains' TLDs have their own folder and files. These TLDs include:
.888 | .bitcoin | .blockchain | .crypto | .dao | .nft | .wallet | .x | .zil
To access any of these sites, you would simply go to pureweb3.tld (.tld being .x for example if you wanted the .x version).

While it would be easy to duplicate the same files across all of the different TLDs, each TLD also allows for testing various features. These can include things such as multiple style sheets versus an all inline style. These kinds of A/B tests will allow for learning more about how the blockchain behaves in real world scenarios.

Overall, this repository aims to bring all the browsers up to the ipfs:// and ipns:// standard for web3 sites.
As it stands now, most browsers do not support web3 domains. Those that do, then display the hash key. For example:
typing ipfs://website.tld should then show you that site, as happens on web2. However, currently even the browsers that support it, then revert to something like:
ipfs://massivelonghashkeyfilledwithnumerals012345etc/index.html
In creating this repository, I would dearly love to be able to update all the TLDs at once, highlighting browsers that support at least some form of domain.tld support, even if they are currently rudimentary. 

There are also some horrendous web2 standards that I'd love to see abolished within the emergence of web3. While at the same time, without going above and beyond, there are several elements I'd love to see become standards in web3. One example of these elemnts would be a simple theme/color selector.

Web3 holds the promise of a better internet for all. I'm excited and energized by it. Now we need to put in work and get all the different elements working. Thus, if you so desire, you can look at this repo as my small contribution toward that better future.

Thanks for stopping by and may you have a great one!
