This repository has been created to test native browser support for web3 sites.

All of the Unstoppable Domains TLDs have their own folder and files.
While it would be easy to dupliacte the same files across all of the different TLDs, each TLD also allows for testing different methods. These include things such as multiple styles files versus all inline style. These kinds of A/B tests will allow for learning more about how the blockchain behaves in real world scenarios.

Thanks for stopping by and may you have a great one!
